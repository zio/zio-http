# ZIO Http

ZIO Http is a scala library for building http apps. It is powered by ZIO and [netty](https://netty.io/) and aims at being the defacto solution for writing, highly scalable and performant web applications using idiomatic scala.

@PROJECT-BADGES@

## Installation

Setup via `build.sbt`:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "dev.zio" %% "zio-http" % "0.0.3"
```

**NOTE:** ZIO Http is compatible with `ZIO 1.x` and `ZIO 2.x`.

## Getting Started

A simple Http server can be built using a few lines of code.

```scala
import zio._
import zio.http._
import zio.http.model.Method

object HelloWorld extends ZIOAppDefault {

  val app: HttpApp[Any, Nothing] = Http.collect[Request] {
    case Method.GET -> !! / "text" => Response.text("Hello World!")
  }

  override val run =
    Server.serve(app).provide(Server.default)
}
```

## Steps to run an example

1. Edit the [RunSettings](https://github.com/zio/zio-http/blob/main/project/BuildHelper.scala#L109) - modify `className` to the example you'd like to run.
2. From sbt shell, run `~example/reStart`. You should see `Server started on port: 8080`.
3. Send curl request for defined `http Routes`, for eg : `curl -i "http://localhost:8080/text"` for `example.HelloWorld`.

## Watch Mode

You can use the [sbt-revolver] plugin to start the server and run it in watch mode using `~ reStart` command on the SBT console.
