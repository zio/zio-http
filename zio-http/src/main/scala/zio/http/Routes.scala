/**
 * Represents a collection of routes, each of which is defined by a pattern and
 * a handler. This data type can be thought of as modeling a routing table,
 * which decides where to direct every endpoint in an API based on both method
 * and path of the request.
 *
 * When you are done building a collection of routes, you typically convert the
 * routes into an [[zio.http.HttpApp]] value, which can be done with the
 * `toHttpApp` method.
 *
 * Routes may have handled or unhandled errors. A route of type `Route[Env,
 * Throwable]`, for example, has not handled its errors by converting them into
 * responses. Such unfinished routes cannot yet be converted into
 * [[zio.http.HttpApp]] values. First, you must handle errors with the
 * `handleError` or `handleErrorCause` methods.
