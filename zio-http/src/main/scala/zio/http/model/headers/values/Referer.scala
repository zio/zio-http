/**
 * The Referer HTTP request header contains the absolute or partial address from
 * which a resource has been requested. The Referer header allows a server to
 * identify referring pages that people are visiting from or where requested
 * resources are being used. This data can be used for analytics, logging,
 * optimized caching, and more.
 *
 * When you click a link, the Referer contains the address of the page that
 * includes the link. When you make resource requests to another domain, the
 * Referer contains the address of the page that uses the requested resource.
 *
 * The Referer header can contain an origin, path, and querystring, and may not
 * contain URL fragments (i.e. #section) or username:password information. The
 * request's referrer policy defines the data that can be included. See
 * Referrer-Policy for more information and examples.
