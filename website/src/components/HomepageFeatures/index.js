        ZIO HTTP is powered by Netty and ZIOâ€™s asynchronous runtime, so all I/O is
        event-driven and non-blocking. This yields extremely high throughput and
        low latency with minimal resource use.

        <p>
          Built entirely on ZIO's effect system, ZIO HTTP gives you built-in
          support for lightweight fibers (highly concurrent "threads"),
          structured error handling, resource safety, and composability.
          You inherit all the benefits of ZIO in your web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have also the rich ecosystem of ZIO libraries at your disposal,
          including ZIO Schema, ZIO Config, and ZIO logging.
        </p>

        <p>
            Designed for cloud-scale deployments, ZIO HTTP supports massive
            concurrency and parallelism inherently. It efficiently manages
            thousands of fibers (lightweight threads) and connections, so your
             services can scale horizontally under load.

            Because the native support of ZIO, features like structured error
            handling, built-in retries, automatic resource cleanup mean faults
            are contained. Also, you have access to observability features like
            structured logging, metrics, tracing, and monitoring.

        <p>
            ZIO HTTP supports both imperative routing and declarative,
            schema-driven endpoints. You describe request and response schemas
            in types and the framework type-checks your handler logic against
            them at compile time. This catches many errors before you even run
            the code and eliminates a lot of boilerplate.

            This is a key feature
            to generate OpenAPI documentation automatically or generate client
            code from OpenAPI specs which leads to seamless API visibility.
