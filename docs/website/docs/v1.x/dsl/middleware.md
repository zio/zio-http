# Middleware

## What is a "Middleware"?
Before introducing middleware, let us understand why they are needed.

Consider the following example where we have two endpoints within HttpApp
* GET a single user by id
* GET all users
```scala
  private val app = Http.collectZIO[Request] {
    case Method.GET -> !! / "users" / id =>
      // core business logic  
      dbService.lookupUsersById(id).map(Response.json(_.json))
    case Method.GET -> !! / "users"    =>
      // core business logic  
      dbService.paginatedUsers(pageNum).map(Response.json(_.json))
  }
```
#### The polluted code violates the principle of "Separation of concerns"

As our application grows, we want to code the following aspects like
* Basic Auth
* Request logging
* Response logging
* Timeout and retry

For both of our example endpoints, our core business logic gets buried under boilerplate like this

```scala
            (for {
                // validate user
                _    <- MyAuthService.doAuth(request)
                // log request
                _    <- logRequest(request)
                // core business logic
                user <- dbService.lookupUsersById(id).map(Response.json(_.json))
                resp <- Response.json(user.toJson)
                // log response
                _    <- logResponse(resp)                
            } yield resp)
                    .timeout(2.seconds)
                    .retryN(5)
```
Imagine repeating this for all our endpoints!!!

So there are two problems with this approach
* We are dangerously coupling our business logic with cross-cutting concerns (like applying timeouts)
* Also, addressing these concerns will require updating code for every single route in the system. For 100 routes we will need to repeat 100 timeouts!!!
* For example, any change related to a concern like the logging mechanism from logback to log4j2 may cause changing signature of `log(..)` function in 100 places.
* On the other hand, this also makes testing core business logic more cumbersome.


This can lead to a lot of boilerplate clogging our neatly written endpoints affecting readability, thereby leading to increased maintenance costs.

## Need for middlewares and handling "aspects"

If we refer to Wikipedia for the definition of an "[Aspect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_(computer_programming))" we can glean the following points.

* An aspect of a program is a feature linked to many other parts of the program (**_most common example, logging_**)., 
* But it is not related to the program's primary function (**_core business logic_**) 
* An aspect crosscuts the program's core concerns (**_for example logging code intertwined with core business logic_**),  
* Therefore, it can violate the principle of "separation of concerns" which tries to encapsulate unrelated functions. (**_Code duplication and maintenance nightmare_**)

Or in short, aspect is a common concern required throughout the application, and its implementation could lead to repeated boilerplate code and in violation of the principle of separation of concerns.
There is a paradigm in the programming world called [aspect-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming) that aims for modular handling of these common concerns in an application. 

Some examples of common "aspects" required throughout the application
- logging,
- timeouts (preventing long-running code)
- retries (or handling flakiness for example while accessing third party APIs)
- authenticating a user before using the REST resource (basic, or custom ones like OAuth / single sign-on, etc).

This is where middleware comes to the rescue. 
Using middlewares we can compose out-of-the-box middlewares (or our custom middlewares) to address the above-mentioned concerns using ++ and @@ operators as shown below.

#### Cleaned up code using middleware to address cross-cutting concerns like auth, request/response logging, etc.
Observe, how we can address multiple cross-cutting concerns using neatly composed middlewares, in a single place.

```scala
// compose basic auth, request/response logging, timeouts middlewares
val composedMiddlewares = Middleware.basicAuth("user","pw") ++ 
        Middleware.debug ++ 
        Middleware.timeout(5 seconds) 
````
And then we can attach our composed bundle of middlewares to an Http using `@@`
```scala
private val app = Http.collectZIO[Request] {
  case Method.GET -> !! / "users" / id =>
    // core business logic  
    dbService.lookupUsersById(id).map(Response.json(_.json))
  case Method.GET -> !! / "users"    =>
    // core business logic  
    dbService.paginatedUsers(pageNum).map(Response.json(_.json))
} @@ composedMiddlewares // attach composedMiddlewares to the app using @@
```
Observe how we gained the following benefits by using middlewares
* **Readability**: de-cluttering business logic.
* **Modularity**: we can manage aspects independently without making changes in 100 places. For example, 
  * replacing the logging mechanism from logback to log4j2 will require a change in one place, the logging middleware.
  * replacing the authentication mechanism from OAuth to single sign-on will require changing the auth middleware
* **Testability**: we can test our aspects independently.

## Middleware in zio-http

A middleware helps in addressing common crosscutting concerns without duplicating boilerplate code.

#### Revisiting HTTP 
[`Http`](https://zio.github.io/zio-http/docs/v1.x/dsl/http) is the most fundamental type for modeling Http applications

```Http[-R, +E, -A, +B]``` is equivalent to ```(A) => ZIO[R, Option[E], B]``` where

* `R` type of Environment 
* `E` type of the Error when the function fails with Some[E]
* `A` is the type of input given to the Http
* `B` type of the output produced by the Http 

Middleware is simply a function that takes one `Http` as a parameter and returns a new `Http` with some enhanced capabilities.,

```Http => Http```

So, a middleware represents function transformation f1 => f2

```scala
type Middleware[R, E, AIn, BIn, AOut, BOut] = Http[R, E, AIn, BIn] => Http[R, E, AOut, BOut]
```
* `AIn` and `BIn` are type params of the input `Http`
* `AOut` and `BOut` are type params of the output `Http`

**HttpApp** is a specialized Http with `Request` and `Response` as input and output
```scala
type HttpApp[-R,+E] = Http[R, E, Request, Response]
```
In the  ```HttpApp``` context, a middleware can modify requests and responses and also transform them into more concrete domain entities.

#### Attaching middleware to Http
`@@` operator is used to attach a middleware to an Http. Example below shows a middleware attached to an HttpApp
```scala
val app = Http.collect[Request] {
  case Method.GET -> !! / name => Response.text(s"Hello $name")
}
val appWithMiddleware = app @@ Middleware.debug
```
Logically the code above translates to `Middleware.debug(app)`
#### A simple middleware example
Let us consider a simple example using out-of-the-box middleware called ```addHeader```
We will write a middleware that will attach a custom header to the response. 

Start with imports
```scala
import zio.http._
import zio.http.Server
import zio.console.{putStrLn}
import zio.{App, ExitCode, URIO}
```
We create a middleware that appends an additional header to the response indicating whether it is a Dev/Prod/Staging environment.
```scala
lazy val patchEnv = Middleware.addHeader("X-Environment", "Dev")
```
A test HttpApp with attached middleware
```scala
val app = Http.collect[Request] {
  case Method.GET -> !! / name => Response.text(s"Hello $name")
}
val appWithMiddleware = app @@ patchEnv
```
Start the server 
```scala
val server = Server.start(8090, appWithMiddleware).exitCode
zio.Runtime.default.unsafeRunSync(server)
```
Fire a curl request and we see an additional header added to the response indicating the "Dev" environment
```
curl -i http://localhost:8090/Bob

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: text/plain
X-Environment: Dev
content-length: 12

Hello Bob
```
### Advanced example showing the transformative power of a middleware (Optional)

<details>
<summary>
Here is a slightly longer example to explore how powerful middleware transformation can be. It shows
<ul>
<li>How we can define a service purely in terms of our domain types</li>
<li>Define a "codec" middleware for decoding requests and encoding responses to and from domain types</li>
<li>Transform our regular `Http` service to an HttpApp by applying our codec middleware</li>
</ul>
<b><i>Note: In real life, we will be using REST endpoints for defining routes. Although you can skip this section, this example gives a deeper insight into middleware.</i></b>
</summary>

Start with imports
```scala
import zio.http.{Http, HttpError, Middleware, Request, Response}
import zio.{ExitCode, URIO, ZEnv, ZIO}
import zio.json._
import zio.http.service._
```
Define some "User" domain types
```scala
final case class User(name: String, email: String, id: String)
object User {
  implicit val codec: JsonCodec[User] = DeriveJsonCodec.gen[User]
}
sealed trait UsersRequest
object UsersRequest {
  final case class Get(id: Int)                        extends UsersRequest
  final case class Create(name: String, email: String) extends UsersRequest
  implicit val decoder: JsonDecoder[UsersRequest] = DeriveJsonDecoder.gen[UsersRequest]
}
sealed trait UsersResponse
object UsersResponse {
  final case class Got(user: User)     extends UsersResponse
  final case class Created(user: User) extends UsersResponse

  implicit val encoder: JsonEncoder[UsersResponse] = DeriveJsonEncoder.gen[UsersResponse]
}
```
Define a Users service _**purely in terms of our types**_
```scala
  val usersService: Http[Any, Nothing, UsersRequest, UsersResponse] = Http.collect {
    case UsersRequest.Create(name, email) => {
      UsersResponse.Created(User(name, email, "abc123"))
    }
    case UsersRequest.Get(id)             => {
      UsersResponse.Got(User(id.toString, "", ""))
    }
  }
```
A codec middleware which transforms an `Http` with different input/output types to `HttpApp` with **Request and Response**
```scala
  def codecMiddleware[In: JsonDecoder, Out: JsonEncoder]: Middleware[Any,Nothing,In,Out,Request,Response] =
    Middleware.codecZIO[Request,Out](
      // deserialize the request into In type or fail with some message
      request =>
        for{
          body <- request.getBodyAsString
          in   <- ZIO.fromEither(JsonDecoder[In].decodeJson(body))
        } yield in,
      out => {
        for {
          charSeq <- ZIO(JsonEncoder[Out].encodeJson(out, None))
        } yield Response.json(charSeq.toString)
      }
    ) <> Middleware.succeed(Response.fromHttpError(HttpError.BadRequest("Invalid JSON")))
```

Let us transform our regular Http with UserService to an HttpApp using our codec middleware

```scala
val transformedHttpApp: Http[Any, Nothing, Request, Response] =
    usersService @@ codecMiddleware[UsersRequest,UsersResponse]
```
Just observe how our service `Http` got transformed to `HttpApp` by applying middleware

`Http[Any, Nothing, UsersRequest, UsersResponse]` ===> `Http[Any, Nothing, Request, Response]` (HttpApp)

Start the server
```scala
val server = Server.start(8090, transformedHttpApp)
zio.Runtime.default.unsafeRunSync(server)
```
Fire a curl request along with the request body
```
curl -i -d '{ "Create":{ "name":"Sum", "email": "s@d1.com" }}' http://localhost:8090/
```
Observe the response
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: application/json
content-length: 68

{"Created":{"user":{"name":"Sum","email":"s@d1.com","id":"abc123"}}
```
</details>   

## Creating Middleware

Refer to [Middleware.scala](https://github.com/zio/zio-http/blob/main/zio-http/src/main/scala/zio/http/Middleware.scala) for various ways of creating a middleware.

Again remember that a "middleware" is just a **_transformative function_**. There are ways of creating such transformative functions:  
* **identity**: works like an [identity function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_function) in mathematics
  `f(x) = x`.
  It returns the same `Http` as input without doing any modification
```scala
val identityMW: Middleware[Any, Nothing, Nothing, Any, Any, Nothing] = Middleware.identity
app @@ identityMW // no effect on the http app.
```
* **succeed** creates a middleware that always returns the output `Http` that succeeds with the given value and never fails.

```scala
val middleware: Middleware[Any, Nothing, Nothing, Any, Any, Int] = Middleware.succeed(1)
```
* **fail** creates a middleware that always returns the output `Http` that always fails.

```scala
val middleware: Middleware[Any, String, Nothing, Any, Any, Nothing] = Middleware.fail("error")
```
* **collect** creates middleware using a specified function

```scala
val middleware: Middleware[Any, Nothing, Request, Response, Request, Response] = Middleware.collect[Request](_ => Middleware.addHeaders(Headers("a", "b")))
```
* **collectZIO** creates middleware using a specified effect function

```scala
val middleware: Middleware[Any, Nothing, Request, Response, Request, Response] = Middleware.collectZIO[Request](_ => ZIO.succeed(Middleware.addHeaders(Headers("a", "b"))))
```
* **codec** takes two functions `decoder: AOut => Either[E, AIn]` and `encoder: BIn => Either[E, BOut]`

The below snippet takes two functions:
  - decoder function to decode Request to String
  - encoder function to encode String to Response

```scala
val middleware: Middleware[Any, Nothing, String, String, Request, Response] = Middleware.codec[Request,String](r => Right(r.method.toString()), s => Right(Response.text(s)))
```
* **fromHttp** creates a middleware with output `Http` as specified `http`

```scala
val app: Http[Any, Nothing, Any, String] = Http.succeed("Hello World!")
val middleware: Middleware[Any, Nothing, Nothing, Any, Request, Response] = Middleware.fromHttp(app)
```

## Combining middlewares

Middlewares can be combined using several special operators like `++`, `<>` and `>>>`

### Using `++` combinator

`++` is an alias for `combine`. It combines two middlewares **_without changing their input/output types (`AIn` = `AOut` / `BIn` = `BOut`)_**

For example, if we have three middlewares f1, f2, f3

f1 ++ f2 ++ f3 applies on an `http`, from left to right with f1 first followed by others, like this 
```scala
  f3(f2(f1(http)))
```
#### A simple example using `++` combinator
Start with imports
```scala
import zio.http.Middleware.basicAuth
import zio.http._
import zio.http.Server
import zio.console.putStrLn
import zio.{App, ExitCode, URIO}
```
A user app with single endpoint that welcomes a user
```scala
val userApp: UHttpApp = Http.collect[Request] { case Method.GET -> !! / "user" / name / "greet" =>
  Response.text(s"Welcome to the ZIO party! ${name}")
}
```
A basicAuth middleware with hardcoded user pw and another patches response with environment value 
```scala
val basicAuthMW = basicAuth("admin", "admin")
lazy val patchEnv = Middleware.addHeader("X-Environment", "Dev")
// apply combined middlewares to the userApp
val appWithMiddleware = userApp @@ (basicAuthMW ++ patchEnv)
```
Start the server
```scala
val server = Server.start(8090, appWithMiddleware).exitCode
zio.Runtime.default.unsafeRunSync(server)
```
Fire a curl request with an incorrect user/password combination
```
curl -i --user admin:wrong http://localhost:8090/user/admin/greet

HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
www-authenticate: Basic
X-Environment: Dev
content-length: 0
```
We notice in the response that first basicAuth middleware responded `HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized` and then patch middleware attached a `X-Environment: Dev` header. 

### Using `>>>`
`>>>` is an alias for `andThen` and similar to `++` with one BIG difference **_input/output types can be different (`AIn`≠ `AOut` / `BIn`≠ `BOut`)_**  
Whereas, in the case of `++` types remain the same (horizontal composition).

For example, if we have three middlewares f1, f2, f3

f1 >>> f2 >>> f3 applies on an `http`, sequentially feeding an http to f1 first followed by f2 and f3.

f1(http) => http1
f2(http1) => http2

### Using `<>` combinator
`<>` is an alias for `orElse`. While using `<>`, if the output `Http` of the first middleware fails, the second middleware will be evaluated, ignoring the result from the first.
#### A simple example using `<>`
```scala
val middleware: Middleware[Any, Nothing, Request, Response, Request, Response] = Middleware.fail("error") <> Middleware.addHeader("X-Environment", "Dev")
```
#### other operators
* **contraMap**,**contraMapZIO**,**delay**,**flatMap**,**flatten**,**map**: which are obvious as their name implies.

* **race** to race middlewares
* **runAfter** and **runBefore** to run effect before and after
* **when** to conditionally run a middleware (input of output Http meets some criteria)

## Transforming Middlewares (some advanced examples)

### Transforming the output of the output `Http`

- We can use `flatMap` or  `map` or `mapZIO` for transforming the output type of output Http

```scala
val middleware: Middleware[Any, Nothing, Nothing, Any, Any, Int] = Middleware.succeed(3)

val mid1: Middleware[Any, Nothing, Nothing, Any, Any, String] = middleware.map((i: Int) => i.toString)
val mid2: Middleware[Any, Nothing, Nothing, Any, Any, String] = middleware.mapZIO((i: Int) => ZIO.succeed(s"$i"))
val mid3: Middleware[Any, Nothing, Nothing, Any, Any, String] = middleware.flatMap((m: Int) => Middleware.succeed(m.toString))
```

- We can use `intercept` or `interceptZIO` to create a new middleware using transformation functions, which changes the output type of the output `Http` keeping input the same.
  
  The below snippet takes two functions:
  - (incoming: A => S)
  - (outgoing: (B, S) => BOut) 
  
```scala
val middleware: Middleware[Any, Nothing, String, String, String, Int] = Middleware.intercept[String, String](_.toInt + 2)((_, a) => a + 3)
  
val mid: Middleware[Any, Nothing, Int, Int, Int, Int] = Middleware.interceptZIO[Int, Int](i => UIO(i * 10))((i, j) => UIO(i + j))
```

### Transforming the Input of the output `Http`

We can use `contramap` or `contramapZIO` for transforming the input type of the output `Http`

```scala
val middleware: Middleware[Any, Nothing, Int, Int, Int, Int] = Middleware.codec[Int, Int](decoder = a => Right(a + 1), encoder = b => Right(b + 1))

val mid1: Middleware[Any, Nothing, Int, Int, String, Int] = middleware.contramap[String](_.toInt)
val mid2: Middleware[Any, Nothing, Int, Int, String, Int] = middleware.contramapZIO[String](a => UIO(a.toInt))
```

## Conditional application of middlewares

- `when` applies middleware only if the condition function evaluates to true

```scala
val middleware: Middleware[Any, Nothing, Nothing, Any, Any, String] = Middleware.succeed("yes")
val mid: Middleware[Any, Nothing, Nothing, Any, String, String] = middleware.when[String]((str: String) => str.length > 2)
```

-`whenZIO` applies middleware only if the condition function(with effect) evaluates

```scala
val middleware: Middleware[Any, Nothing, Nothing, Any, Any, String] = Middleware.succeed("yes")
val mid: Middleware[Any, Nothing, Nothing, Any, String, String] = middleware.whenZIO[Any, Nothing, String]((str: String) => UIO(str.length > 2))
```

Logical operators to decide which middleware to select based on the predicate:

- Using `ifThenElse` 

```scala
val mid: Middleware[Any, Nothing, Nothing, Any, Int, Int] = Middleware.ifThenElse[Int](_ > 5)(
    isTrue = i => Middleware.succeed(i + 1),
    isFalse = i => Middleware.succeed(i - 1)
  )
```
- Using `ifThenElseZIO` 

```scala
val mid: Middleware[Any, Nothing, Nothing, Any, Int, Int] = Middleware.ifThenElseZIO[Int](i => UIO(i > 5))(
    isTrue = i => Middleware.succeed(i + 1),
    isFalse = i => Middleware.succeed(i - 1),
  )
```
