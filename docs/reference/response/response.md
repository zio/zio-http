**ZIO HTTP** `Response` is designed to encode HTTP Response.
It supports all HTTP status codes and headers along with custom methods and headers (as defined in [RFC2616](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616) )

## Response Usage

In ZIO HTTP, a `Response` is used in two contexts, server-side and client-side.

### Server Side

In the server-side context, a `Response` is created and returned by a `Handler`:

```scala mdoc:compile-only
import zio._
import zio.http._

object HelloWorldExample extends ZIOAppDefault {
  val routes: Routes[Any, Response] =
    Routes(
      Method.GET / "text" ->
        handler {
          Response.text("Hello World!")
        },
      )

  override val run = Server.serve(routes).provide(Server.default)
}
```

### Client Side

In the client-side context, a `Response` is received from the client after making a request to a server:

```scala mdoc:compile-only
import zio._
import zio.http.Header.ContentType.render
import zio.http._

object ClientExample extends ZIOAppDefault {
  val program = for {
    res         <- Client.request(Request.get("https://zio.dev/"))
    contentType <- ZIO.from(res.header(Header.ContentType))
    _           <- Console.printLine("------Content Type------")
    _           <- Console.printLine(render(contentType))
    data        <- res.body.asString
    _           <- Console.printLine("----------Body----------")
    _           <- Console.printLine(data)
  } yield ()

  override val run = program.provide(Client.default, Scope.default)
}
```

## Creating a Response

A `Response` can be created with `status`, `headers`, and `data` using the default constructor:

```scala
case class Response(
  status: Status = Status.Ok,
  headers: Headers = Headers.empty,
  body: Body = Body.empty,
)
```

The below snippet creates a response with default params, `status` as `Status.OK`, `headers` as `Headers.empty`, and `data` as `Body.Empty`:

```scala mdoc
import zio.http._
import zio._

Response()
```

### Status Codes

ZIO HTTP has several constructors for the most common status codes:

| Method                                   | Description                                                                                                                    | Status Code                         |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `Response.ok`                            | Successful request                                                                                                             | 200 OK                              |
| `Response.badRequest`                    | The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error                                              | 400 Bad Request                     |
| `Response.unauthorized`                  | Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically for use when authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided | 401 Unauthorized                    |
| `Response.forbidden`                     | The client does not have access rights to the content; that is, it is unauthorized                                             | 403 Forbidden                       |
| `Response.notFound`                      | The requested resource could not be found but may be available in the future                                                   | 404 Not Found                       |
| `Response.internalServerError`           | A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable           | 500 Internal Server Error           |
| `Response.serviceUnavailable`            | The server cannot handle the request (because it is overloaded or down for maintenance)                                        | 503 Service Unavailable             |
| `Response.redirect`                      | Used to inform the client that the resource they're requesting is located at a different URI                                   | 302 Found (Moved Temporarily)       |
| `Response.seeOther`                      | Tells the client to look at a different URL for the requested resource                                                         | 303 See Other                       |
| `Response.gatewayTimeout`                | The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and did not receive a timely response from the upstream server                     | 504 Gateway Timeout                 |
| `Response.httpVersionNotSupported`       | The server does not support the HTTP protocol version that was used in the request                                             | 505 HTTP Version Not Supported      |
| `Response.networkAuthenticationRequired` | The client needs to authenticate to gain network access                                                                        | 511 Network Authentication Required |
| `Response.notExtended`                   | Further extensions to the request are required for the server to fulfill it                                                    | 510 Not Extended                    |
| `Response.notImplemented`                | The server either does not recognize the request method, or it lacks the ability to fulfill the request                        | 501 Not Implemented                 |

For example, to create a response with status code 200, we can use `Response.ok`:

```scala mdoc
Response.ok
```

And also to create a response with status code 404, we can use `Response.badRequest`:

```scala mdoc
Response.notFound

Response.notFound("The requested resource could not be found!")
```

If we want to create a response with a more specific status code, we can use the `status` method. It takes a `Status` as a parameter and returns a new `Response` with the corresponding status code:

```scala mdoc:compile-only
Response.status(Status.Continue)
```

To learn more about status codes, see [Status](status.md) page.

### From Plain Text, JSON, and HTML

**`Response.text`** creates a response with data as text, content-type header set to text/plain, and status code 200:

```scala mdoc
Response.text("hey")
```

**`Response.json`** creates a response with data as JSON, content-type header set to `application/json`, and status code 200:

```scala mdoc
Response.json("""{"greetings": "Hello World!"}""")
```

**`Response.html`** creates a response with data as HTML, content-type header set to `text/html`, and status code 200.

```scala mdoc
import zio.http.template._

Response.html(Html.fromString("html text"))
```

### Converting Failures to Responses

The `Response` companion object provides some constructors to convert exceptions into responses. These constructors are useful for error handling by converting failures into appropriate HTTP responses:

**`Response.fromThrowable`** Creates a new HTTP response based on the type of throwable provided. This method facilitates the conversion of various types of exceptions into appropriate HTTP responses, making error handling more streamlined:

```scala
object Response {
  def fromThrowable(throwable: Throwable): Response = ???
}
```

Here is the table of exceptions and their corresponding status code:

| Throwable Type                    | Status Class          | Status Code | Description                                  |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `AccessDeniedException`           | `Forbidden`           | 403         | Access to a resource is denied.              |
| `IllegalAccessException`          | `Forbidden`           | 403         | Illegal access to a resource is attempted.   |
| `IllegalAccessError`              | `Forbidden`           | 403         | Illegal access to a resource occurs.         |
| `NotDirectoryException`           | `BadRequest`          | 400         | The specified path is not a directory.       |
| `IllegalArgumentException`        | `BadRequest`          | 400         | An invalid argument is provided.             |
| `java.io.FileNotFoundException`   | `NotFound`            | 404         | The specified file or resource is not found. |
| `java.net.ConnectException`       | `ServiceUnavailable`  | 503         | Unable to connect to a service.              |
| `java.net.SocketTimeoutException` | `GatewayTimeout`      | 504         | Connection or read operation timed out.      |
| Others (unrecognized throwable)   | `InternalServerError` | 500         | An unexpected error occurred.                |

Another low-level method for error handling is `Response.fromCause` which creates a response from a `Cause`:

```scala
object Response {
  def fromCause(cause: Cause[Any]): Response = ???
}
```

This constructor is similar to `Response.fromThrowable`, but it also captures the interruption of the fiber. If the provided `Cause` is a failure due to interruption, the status code of the response will be `Status.RequestTimeout`.

We can use `Response.fromCause` in combination with the `Handler#mapErrorCause`, `Route#handleErrorCause`, and `Routes#handleErrorCause` methods. These methods take a function that maps the `Cause[Err] => Err` and return a `Handler`, `Route` or a `Routes` with the error handling logic applied:

```scala mdoc
import zio.http._
import java.io.IOException

val failedHandler = Handler.fail(new IOException())

failedHandler.mapErrorCause(Response.fromCause)
```

:::note
In many cases, it is more convenient to use the `sandbox` method to automatically convert all failures into a corresponding `Response`. But in some cases, to have more granular control over the error handling, we may want to use `Response.fromCause` and `Response.fromThrowable` directly.

:::info
The `Cause` is a data structure that represents the result of a failed computation in ZIO. To learn more about `Cause`, see the [Cause](https://zio.dev/reference/core/cause) page on the ZIO core documentation.

### Specialized Response Operators

`status` to update the `status` of `Response`

```scala mdoc
Response.text("Hello World!").status(Status.NotFound)
```

`updateHeaders` to update the `headers` of `Response`

```scala mdoc
Response.ok.updateHeaders(_ => Headers("key", "value"))
```

### Response from HTTP Errors

`error` creates a response with a provided status code and message.

```scala mdoc
 Response.error(Status.BadRequest, "It's not good!")
```

### Creating a Response from Server-Sent Events

The `Response.fromServerSentEvents` method creates a response with a stream of server-sent events:

```scala
object Response {
  def fromServerSentEvents(stream: ZStream[Any, Nothing, ServerSentEvent]): Response = ???
}
```

Let's try a complete example:

```scala mdoc:compile-only
import zio._
import zio.http._
import zio.stream._
import java.time.LocalDateTime
import java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter.ISO_LOCAL_TIME

object ServerSentExample extends ZIOAppDefault {

  val stream: ZStream[Any, Nothing, ServerSentEvent] =
    ZStream.repeatWithSchedule(
      ServerSentEvent(ISO_LOCAL_TIME.format(LocalDateTime.now)),
      Schedule.spaced(1.second),
    )

  val app =
    Routes(
      Method.GET / "events" -> handler {
        Response.fromServerSentEvents(stream)
      },
    )
  def run = Server.serve(app).provide(Server.default)
}
```

After running the above example, we can open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/events` to see the server-sent events in action. The browser will display the time every second.

Also, we can use the `curl` command to see the server-sent events:

```bash
curl -N http://localhost:8080/events
```

This will display the time every second in the terminal:

```bash
data: 13:51:31.036249

data: 13:51:32.037663

data: 13:51:33.039565

data: 13:51:34.041464

...
```

### Creating a Response from a WebSocketApp

The `Response.fromWebSocketApp` constructor takes a `WebSocketApp` and creates a `Response` with a WebSocket connection:

```scala
object Response {
  def fromWebSocketApp[R](app: WebSocketApp[R]): ZIO[R, Nothing, Response] = ???
}
```

Let's try an echo server which sends back the received messages:

```scala mdoc:compile-only
import zio._
import zio.http._

object WebsocketExample extends ZIOAppDefault {

  val routes: Routes[Any, Response] = {
    Routes(
      Method.GET / "echo" -> handler {
        Response.fromSocketApp(
          WebSocketApp(
            handler { (channel: WebSocketChannel) =>
              channel.receiveAll {
                case ChannelEvent.Read(message) =>
                  channel.send(ChannelEvent.read(message))
                case other =>
                  ZIO.debug(other)
              }
            },
            ),
          )
      },
      )
  }

  def run =
    Server.serve(routes).provide(Server.default)
}
```

To test this example, we can use the `websocat` command-line tool:

```bash
> websocat ws://localhost:8080/echo
hello
hello
bye
bye
```

## Operations

### Adding Cookies and Flashes to Response

**`addCookie`** adds cookies in the headers of the response:

```scala mdoc:compile-only
import zio.http._

val cookie = Cookie.Response("key", "value")
Response.ok.addCookie(cookie)
```

**`addFlash`** adds flash messages in the headers of the response:

```scala mdoc:compile-only
import zio.http._

val flash = Flash.setValue("key1", "value1")
Response.ok.addFlash(flash)
```

### Working with Headers

There are various methods to work with headers in `Response` which we have discussed in the [Headers](../headers/headers.md#headers-operations) page.
