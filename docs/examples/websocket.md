This example shows how to create a WebSocket server using ZIO Http and how to write a client to connect to it.

## Server

First we define a `WebSocketApp` that will handle the WebSocket connection.
The `Handler.webSocket` constructor gives access to the `WebSocketChannel`. The channel can be used to receive messages from the client and send messages back.
We use the `receiveAll` method, to pattern match on the different channel events that could occur.
The most important events are `Read` and `UserEventTriggered`. The `Read` event is triggered when the client sends a message to the server. The `UserEventTriggered` event is triggered when the connection is established.
We can identify the successful connection of a client by receiving a `UserEventTriggered(UserEvent.HandshakeComplete)` event. And if the client sends us a text message, we will receive a `Read(WebSocketFrame.Text(<text>))` event.

Our WebSocketApp will handle the following events send by the client:
* If the client connects to the server, we will send a "Greetings!" message to the client.
* If the client sends "foo", we will send a "bar" message back to the client.
* If the client sends "bar", we will send a "foo" message back to the client.
* If the client sends "end", we will close the connection.
* If the client sends any other message, we will send the same message back to the client 10 times.

For the client to establish a connection with the server, we offer the `/subscriptions` endpoint.

```scala mdoc:passthrough
import utils._

printSource("zio-http-example/src/main/scala/example/WebSocketAdvanced.scala", lines=Seq((3, 7), (9, 60)), showLineNumbers=false)
```

A few things worth noting:
* `Server.default` starts a server on port 8080.
* `socketApp.toResponse` converts the `WebSocketApp` to a `Response`, so we can serve it with `handler`.


## Client

The client will connect to the server and send a message to the server every time the user enters a message in the console.
For this we will use the `Console.readLine` method to read a line from the console. We will then send the message to the server using the `WebSocketChannel.send` method.
But since we don't want to reconnect to the server every time the user enters a message, we will use a `Queue` to store the messages. We will then use the `Queue.take` method to take a message from the queue and send it to the server, whenever a new message is available.
Adding a new message to the queue, as well as sending the messages to the server, should happen in a loop in the background. For this we will use the operators `forever` (looping) and `forkDaemon` (fork to a background fiber).

Again we will use the `Handler.webSocket` constructor to define how to handle messages and create a `WebSocketApp`. But this time, instead of serving the `WebSocketApp` we will use the `connect` method to establish a connection to the server.
All we need for that, is the URL of the server. In our case it's `"ws://localhost:8080/subscriptions"`.

```scala mdoc:passthrough
import utils._

printSource("zio-http-example/src/main/scala/example/WebSocketAdvanced.scala", lines=Seq((3, 7), (62, 99)), showLineNumbers=false)
```

While we access here `Queue[String]` via the ZIO environment, you should use a service in a real world application, that requires a queue as one of its constructor dependencies.
See [ZIO Services](https://zio.dev/reference/service-pattern/) for more information.


## WebSocket Echo

```scala mdoc:passthrough
import utils._

printSource("zio-http-example/src/main/scala/example/WebSocketEcho.scala")
```
